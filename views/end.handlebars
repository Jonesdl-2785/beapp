<p>let out another one of those mirthless, terrifying laughs and turned back to his? its?, business at hand...eating all of the food in my house!</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, fear quickly turned into anger</p>
<p>Hey, I said, What the heck are you doing?</p><p>Who are you? What are you? Leave now or I will call the police!!! I said as intimidatingly as I could to the 8-foot person, thing standing in my kitchen eating all of my food.</p>
<p>He sat the chocolate cake he had stared on, down on the counter, and turned back to me.</p>
<p>'My apologies, Ms. Katie, I was just so hungry. You see, I haven't eaten in 570 years!'</p>
<p>570 years!  How is that possible?? No one lives that long! Do you think I was just born yesterday? Who are you? I scream, because I was getting PO'd.</p>
<p>'Let me introduce myself', he said.</p>
<p>'I am Tobias Trinity Stone-Von Hymleichstein, your father, and you were, in fact, born yesterday', he said with a slight, mischievous smile, 'and this', pointing to a equally tall woman I hadn't noticed previously, 'is your mother'.</p>
<p>Confused, I didn't notice I had dropped both my weapons until the glass bottle shattered and the iron bar barely missed my big toe.</p>
<p>'I am 25 years old', I state forcefully, 'and, I remember everyday day of my life, seeing I have an eidetic memory and all...so, explain that....Ren and Stimpy!'</p>
<p>The woman-thing moves toward me and says with a slight authority, 'sit down dear, let us explain', then she pull up a giant-sized chair and sits with her fingers laced, waiting for me to do the same.</p>
